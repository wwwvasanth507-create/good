# Campus Video Player - Test Results & Feature Summary

## ✅ SQLITE ERROR FIXED!

### What Was Fixed:
The SQLite database URI configuration was updated to handle Windows paths properly:

**Before:**
```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'app.db')
```

**After:**
```python
db_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'app.db').replace('\\', '/')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = f'sqlite:///{db_path}'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS'] = {
    'connect_args': {'check_same_thread': False}
}
```

This ensures:
- Proper forward slash format for SQLite URIs on Windows
- Thread-safe operations with the `check_same_thread` parameter
- Compatibility with Flask-SQLAlchemy
